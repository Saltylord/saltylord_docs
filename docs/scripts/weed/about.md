Allow players to plant indoors, with IPL / instance support. Give your players the most immersive plant breeding experience and truely unlimited plant strain variations by placing female and male plants next to each other and waiting for them to pollinate. Allowing players to name their own strains, select their own models, and select their own inventory images for plants giving your players unique customization options.*
